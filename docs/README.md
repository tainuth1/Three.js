# Three.js Learning Journey Documentation

This documentation covers all the Three.js concepts learned through practical examples in `main.js` and `light.js`. Each section provides detailed explanations of objects, classes, and their properties.

## üìö Documentation Structure

### Core Setup

- [Scene, Camera & Renderer Setup](./01-scene-camera-renderer.md) - Basic Three.js scene initialization
- [Animation Loop](./02-animation-loop.md) - Understanding the render loop and animations

### 3D Objects & Materials

- [Geometries](./03-geometries.md) - All geometry types and their properties
- [Materials](./04-materials.md) - Material types, properties, and usage
- [Textures & Mapping](./05-textures-mapping.md) - Texture loading and material mapping

### Lighting System

- [Lighting](./06-lighting.md) - Ambient, point, and directional lights
- [Shadows](./07-shadows.md) - Shadow casting and receiving

### User Interaction

- [Raycasting & Interaction](./08-raycasting-interaction.md) - Mouse interaction and object selection
- [Controls](./09-controls.md) - OrbitControls and camera manipulation

### Helpers & Debugging

- [Helpers & Debugging](./10-helpers-debugging.md) - Helper objects for development

### Advanced Concepts

- [Background & Environment](./11-background-environment.md) - Scene backgrounds and environment setup
- [Math Utilities](./12-math-utilities.md) - Three.js math functions and utilities

## üöÄ Quick Start

Each document follows this structure:

1. **Concept Overview** - What the concept is and why it's important
2. **Code Examples** - Practical examples from the learning files
3. **Properties & Methods** - Detailed API reference
4. **Best Practices** - Tips and common patterns
5. **Common Pitfalls** - What to avoid

## üìÅ Source Files

- `src/main.js` - Main learning file with comprehensive examples
- `src/light.js` - Lighting and shadow examples

## üéØ Learning Path

1. Start with [Scene, Camera & Renderer Setup](./01-scene-camera-renderer.md)
2. Learn about [Geometries](./03-geometries.md) and [Materials](./04-materials.md)
3. Understand [Lighting](./06-lighting.md) and [Shadows](./07-shadows.md)
4. Add [Textures & Mapping](./05-textures-mapping.md)
5. Implement [Raycasting & Interaction](./08-raycasting-interaction.md)
6. Use [Helpers & Debugging](./10-helpers-debugging.md) for development
